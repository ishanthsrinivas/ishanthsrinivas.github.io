👨🏽‍💻 I'm a freshman at the University of Chicago, double majoring in Data Science and Economics. 

📈 I have a strong interest in consulting and private equity.

🐍 I've built a solid foundation in statistical analysis and machine learning using Python. Check out some of my projects! 
 
⚜️ Outside of academics, I am proud to be an Eagle Scout and a finalist for the prestigious Breakthrough Junior Challenge. 
 
💡 My personal interests include gardening, reading, creating YouTube videos, and playing the tabla. 

✅ I'm always eager explore data science's use in driving large-scale business decisions in the finance world.

🚀 Feel free to connect with me to discuss potential collaborations or shared interests!

# My Story

I've always been interested in both the humanities and STEM, but what I truly love is problem-solving. Whether it's tackling difficult escape rooms or diving into complex online cryptography puzzles, I enjoy mental challenges that push my creative and analytical limits. So, I knew I needed a career that combined these aspects of who I am.

In high school, I initially pursued engineering because I loved using math and science to solve problems. However, I realized that there were limited opportunities to engage with my passion for the humanities in this field.

While running a multi-week chemistry summer camp, I also discovered a passion for business and the satisfaction that comes from building something from the ground up.

Heading into 2023, I explored the world of finance and found it to be the perfect blend of my diverse interests. Now, I’m excited for the challenges and growth opportunities this field offers.

# Selected Experiences + Projects

## Geant-4 Simulations

I've always had an interest in physics, so simulation libraries such as CERN's Geant-4 gave me cool tools to play around with. Check out my Cherenkov radiation detector and my deep space radiation penetration projects, and read more about the process of making these projects in my blog.

## Breakthrough Junior Challenge

For this international science competition, I created a 2 minute video about Bose Einstein Condensate. I used simple analogies to simply explain high level science concepts, like using ping pong balls in a cardboard box to describe how wave functions work.
